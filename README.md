# String Reply Rules Service
The **String Reply Rules Service** takes in an input string (in the format of `\d\d-[a-z0-9]*`)
and returns the input in a JSON object.

For example,

```
GET /v2/reply/11-kbzw9ru
{
    "data": "kbzw9ru"
}
```

The input string will now be comprised of two components, a rule and a string, separated by a dash (-).
Rules **always** contain two numbers. Each number represents a string operation.

The supported numbers are:

- `1`: reverse the string

   E.g. `kbzw9ru` becomes `ur9wzbk`

- `2`: encode the string via MD5 hash algorithm and display as hex

   E.g. `kbzw9ru` becomes `0fafeaae780954464c1b29f765861fad`

The numbers are applied in sequence, i.e. the output of the first rule will
serve as the input of the second rule. The numbers can also be repeated,
i.e. a rule of 11 would mean reversing the string twice, resulting in no change to the string.

Giving a few examples,

```
GET /v2/reply/11-kbzw9ru
{
    "data": "kbzw9ru"
}
```
```
GET /v2/reply/12-kbzw9ru
{
    "data": "5a8973b3b1fafaeaadf10e195c6e1dd4"
}
```
```
GET /v2/reply/22-kbzw9ru
{
    "data": "e8501e64cf0a9fa45e3c25aa9e77ffd5"
}
```
**Note:** Rules are defined as ENUM(RuleType) in the ReplyMsgService.java .To add additional rules add a new value in the Rule type

Once the service started, the endpoint will be available at `localhost:8080`, so you can make request to the service endpoint

```json
GET /v2/reply/12-kbzw9ru
